Project Title
This repository contains a modified version of the TextAttack library, designed to enhance adversarial text attack generation and fine-tuning processes. The primary changes are made to the xxx file, which should be placed in the xxx location of the TextAttack version xxx for proper functionality.

Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Install TextAttack:
Follow the installation instructions for TextAttack from their official repository.

Replace the modified file:
Copy the xxx file from this repository and replace the corresponding file in your local TextAttack installation at textattack/version_xxx/xxx.

Usage
To generate adversarial samples and use them for fine-tuning, follow the standard TextAttack procedures. Detailed usage can be found in the TextAttack documentation.

Adversarial Sample Generation
You can generate adversarial samples using various attack methods provided by TextAttack. Once generated, these samples can be fine-tuned as per your requirements.

Reusing Adversarial Samples
To reuse adversarial samples, store them in a CSV file and load them as needed. We have provided a sample data file in the repository for reference. For additional data or queries, please contact the authors or generate new adversarial samples using the attack methods provided.

Example
Below is a basic example to get you started:

Generate Adversarial Samples:

from textattack import Attacker, AttackArgs
from textattack.datasets import Dataset

# Load your dataset
dataset = Dataset(["This is a sample input."], ["This is the corresponding label."])

# Set up the attack
attack_args = AttackArgs(num_examples=1, log_to_csv="adversarial_samples.csv")
attacker = Attacker(attack_args)
attack_results = attacker.attack_dataset(dataset)
Fine-tune with Adversarial Samples:
Load the adversarial samples from the CSV file and use them for fine-tuning your model.
