# Usage
To generate adversarial samples and use them for fine-tuning, follow the standard TextAttack procedures. Detailed usage can be found in the TextAttack documentation.

Adversarial Sample Generation
You can generate adversarial samples using various attack methods provided by TextAttack. Once generated, these samples can be fine-tuned as per your requirements. The creation process can be referenced from the TextAttack official documentation.

Reusing Adversarial Samples
To reuse adversarial samples, store them in a CSV file and load them as needed. We have provided a sample data file in the repository for reference. For additional data or queries, please contact the authors or generate new adversarial samples using the attack methods provided.

Fine-Tuning Process
The entire fine-tuning workflow can be referenced from the pseudocode section of our paper.
